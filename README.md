## Time serie analysis of CO2 emission at Mauna Loa

This work is about using time series methods to forecast in one year into the future what would become the co2 emissions.

The main purpose was to show an ultimate way of finding the SARIMA parameters more easily as I struggled in the past finding them.

After reading this, you will be ready to more easily find the parameters four your studies!
